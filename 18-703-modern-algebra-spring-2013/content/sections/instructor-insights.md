Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _18.703 Modern Algebra_ as it was taught by Prof. James McKernan in Spring 2013.

This is a first course in abstract algebra. The focus of the course is on traditional algebra topics that have found the greatest application in science and engineering, as well as in mathematics.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

Students will learn the definition and basic properties of groups, permutation groups, groups of small order, cosets, Lagrange's theorem, the classification of finite abelian groups, normal subgroups, quotient groups, simple groups and the Sylow Theorems. Students will also learn the definition of rings, basic properties of rings, ideals, quotient rings, integral domains, fields of fractions, unique factorization domains and principal ideal domains, and the classification of finite fields.

Curriculum Information
----------------------

### Prerequisites

Calculus II GIR ![](/images/educator/icon-question-gir.png)

Any of the following courses at MIT will prepare you for 18.703:

*   [_18.02 Calculus_](/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)
*   [_18.022 Calculus_](/courses/18-022-calculus-of-several-variables-fall-2010/)
*   [_18.024 Calculus with Theory_](/courses/18-024-multivariable-calculus-with-theory-spring-2011/)
*   [_18.02A Calculus_](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m18a.html#18.02A)
*   [_CC.1802 Calculus_](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mCCa.html#CC.1802)
*   [_CC.182A Calculus_](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mCCa.html#CC.182A)
*   [_ES.1802 Calculus_](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mESa.html#ES.1802)
*   [_ES.182A Calculus_](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mESa.html#ES.182A)

### Requirements Satisfied

This course has similar content to [_18.702 Algebra II_](/courses/18-702-algebra-ii-spring-2011/), and at most one of the subjects can be counted toward an undergraduate [major](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/) or [minor](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/minor/) in mathematics.

### Offered

Every spring semester

Assessment
----------

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 50% Homework; Late problem sets are not accepted; however, the lowest problem set score will be dropped.
- 20% Midterm exams (10% each)
- 30% Final exam

Student Information
-------------------

![11 students took this course in Spring 2013.](/coursemedia/18-703-modern-algebra-spring-2013/8e63e817642f22081b770cc723959223_18-703_stat-students.png)

### Enrollment

Enrollment has varied each year from ~10 students to 30 students.

### Typical Student Background

This course is intended for math majors and anyone interested in the applications of abstract algebra, perhaps someone interested in theoretical computer science.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

Lecture
-------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 24 sessions total.
*   The final exam was held during Finals Week, in one 3-hour session.

Out of Class
------------

*   [Read the assigned sections]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) in the textbook
*   Work on [homework assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments)
*   Study for the [exams]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/exams)
