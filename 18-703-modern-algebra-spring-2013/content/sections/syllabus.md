This undergraduate course focuses on traditional algebra topics that have found greatest application in science and engineering as well as in mathematics. Topics include group theory, emphasizing finite groups; ring theory, including ideals and unique factorization in polynomial and Euclidean rings; field theory, including properties and applications of finite fields. [_Linear Algebra 18.700_](/courses/18-700-linear-algebra-fall-2013) and [_Modern Algebra 18.703_]({{< baseurl >}}/) together form a standard algebra sequence.
